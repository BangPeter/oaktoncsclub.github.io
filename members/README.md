# Oakton Computer Science Club Member Pages
This is @dgramop's sad attempt to revive the practice of "public home directories"

## Background
Ok so let's go way back to "mainframes" and when people shared the same server/computer to do stuff. Way back then each user got their own folder. Home directories in unix (~) are usually stored for all users (except root) at the /home folder. And basically the sysadmin would put up a webserver and everybody would like create files in a special folder of their home directory marked public served /~<username> .
  
## Ok cool. I'm leaving
Colleges and workplaces *will* google you. And you kinda don't have direct control of what they see, so putting up your own little page is enough for you to write all sorts of crap that they'll take at face value.

## But I can't code
Alright I'm not kidding you you can literally know HTML tags and write like a half-decent web page that kinda works
  - `<br/>` - break, goes to the next line (like hitting enter)
  - `<hr/>` - draws a vertical line
  - `<b>*bold stuff*</b>` to make things bold
  - `<i>_italic stuff_</i>` to make things italic
  - `<a href="https://google.com">Search the web with G00gle</a>` create a link.
There are plenty of tutorials online. Pages can be really simple, they don't have to look fancy or anything. It's a great place to document your work, maybe create some sort of brag sheet, or a page that links people to stuff that you do/did. Creating your own page makes you look a lot better than using Wix, it eliminates any of the BS ads that they push into your site, and it allows people to focus on what's important. The design on Wix and most web builders often _distracts_ from the point you're trying to get across.

## Ok cool I have a few minutes let's start
Alright, cool, so first, you need a github account. Ideally have it include your first name and last name in some sense (like dgramop for Dhruv Gramopadhye)
### Make a GitHub account
Follow this tutorial here: https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/ , then come back
### Create a pull request with the first file
![screw this images aren't loading](https://github.com/oaktoncsclub/oaktoncsclub.github.io/members/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-03%20at%2010.46.47%20AM.png)
  - head over to our page
  - click on the "members" folder
  - click on Create new file
  - type in your GitHub username, 
    - exactly as it appears. You can click on your profile picture in the top left corner of the screen to see your github username
  - type in (the same top file name box) "/index.html" and you're set! index.html will be the default page that people will see when they open your website. That page can have links to other pages (which can have links to other pages, which can have links to other pages, etc)
  - The file name should say oaktoncsclub.github.io/members/(your username)/index.html
  - You can now write your HTML. 
We're working on bringing in a GitHub bot that will automatically generate pages for you if you put in a blank page, so keep an eye out for that if this is too hard.

Once you create the pull request, one of the officers will review it. If you think you got forgotton, just tag @dgramop or Andrew Li, and one of us will be there to help. If you need help, you can leave a commend in your pull request (and tag us), email dgramopadhye@gmail.com, or tag @Officer on the discord.
